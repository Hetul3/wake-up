## The Nextjs Wake Up Website is Here!

When we wake up, our first actions are to look at our phones to get caught up for the day. But what if you wanted to limit that time while still gaining all important information?

Introduce this to your morning routine and take 2 minutes to get caught up on the weather, stocks, news, and have a quote to motivate you throughout the day.

You can view the website here https://wake-up-ten.vercel.app.
Note: the newsapi's free tier doesn't allow for commercial use, so you can't access the news section of the website, just skip over it. If anyone has a free solution to this, let me know.
